							This fast should commence on a Friday and subsequently, one should
							follow it for 11 or 21 Fridays excluding any breaks. If for some reason, it
							cannot be followed on consecutive Fridays, the follower can observe the
							fast for a total number of 11 or 21 Fridays. Devotees usually abstain from
							food during the entire day. If one does not have the stamina to do so,
							eating fruits and milk is permitted. Alternately, one can either eat a meal
							after the puja during the night or any offerings made to the Goddess. The
							devotee starts the day by waking up early, concentrating on the Goddess
							by reciting 'Jai Maha Lakshmi' with deep faith and clear heart.
							The puja is performed in the evening when the sun sets. After cleaning the
							puja altar, make a rangoli and place uncooked rice on it to form a square.
							Before starting the puja, establish a kalasham with water, cardomam,
							edible camphor and saffron. Close it with a lid containing coins. The
							Vaibhava Lakshmi yantram or Ashtalakshmi picture can be placed nearby
							for worship. The yantram, picture and the kalasham can be decorated with
							sandalwood paste, kumkum and flowers.<br>
							Make a thick paste of turmeric powder (around 1 tsp full) with few drops
							of water to form a small cone. This will be used for the Ganesh puja.<br>
							The Vaibhava Lakshmi puja commences with the Ganesh puja, followed
							by the Vaibhava Lakshmi worship, listening or reading the Vaibhava
							Lakshmi legend and bhajans, ending with an aarti. A sweet dish, usually a
							milk-rice pudding is offered to the Goddess after that. The water in the
							Kalasham and the offering can be consumed and later distributed to
							others. The rice could be used for cooking and the coins can be utilized
							for other worship. On the concluding Friday, Vaibhava Lakshmi books are
							to be distributed to 11, 21, 51, or 101 people.<br>

					<font color=red><b>Vaibhava Lakshmi Katha</b></font><br>
					<font color=blue>Many years ago there was a very big city. Lakhs of people lived there. In
					ancient times, people really lived the happy social life. They used to meet
					and sit together and enjoyed themselves. In those days, people used to
					lead the life completely in different way. People of this city were totally
					busy engaged in their own personal worldly affairs. The elements of holy
					devotion, benevolence, sympathy and affection all these virtues were
					rarely visible in the cultural life of the society. Innumerable vices had
					spread in the daily-life of the citizens living in that city. Wine and
					gambling, race and speculation, illegal relations and various guilty
					misdeeds were done by the people living in that city.<br>
					There is always a silver line hidden among the black clouds in the sky.
					The lightning of the eternal hope spreads into the thousands of dark clouds
					of disappointments. Inspite of so many vices prevailing in the social life
					some pious people lived the virtuous life like the lotus in the muddy water
					of the pond. Among all the virtuous people, Sheela and her husband also
					lived pious worldly life. Sheela was of religious nature living the
					contented life. Her husband was a humble fellow having good character.
					Sheela and her husband lived honestly. They never abused or displeased
					anyone. They were happy to utilize their time in worshipping God. Their
					worldly life was ideal and people never got tired while praising them.
					Thus she had been passing her life happily. It is said that the end of the
					misdeeds is quite strange. Who could read the words of fate written by the
					Goddess of Fortune? A king becomes a poor man, and a poor man
					becomes a king. By the destiny, in just a moment, such a great change can
					be done. As a result of misdeeds done, Sheela's husband got the company
					of bad friends. It is said that the man is influenced by the company he
					keeps. Due to the influence of the company of bad friends, Sheela's
					husband dreamed to be one of the wealthiest people gaining crores of
					rupees. As a result he misled his life and became as good as a beggar
					instead of becoming the wealthy person. He followed evil ways of
					immorality and began to ruin his life. He indulged in drinking wine,
					gambling, and race, speculation that had spread in the city-life. His friends
					were also on the same immoral path. He began to waste his money in the
					way of immorality. And at last he lost all the savings and also the
					ornaments of his wife. Once there was a golden time when he was passing
					his life happily with his wife and they were utilizing the time in
					worshiping God. Now there was a great change in their life. They became
					so poor that they could not get food to satisfy their hunger. Moreover
					Sheela had to suffer much due to the abusive language of her husband.
					Sheela was a polite and well-cultured woman. She had suffered a lot
					because of her husband's misbehavior. But keeping faith in God she
					began o bear the sufferings of unhappy life. Unhappiness is followed by
					happiness and happiness is followed by unhappiness in this worldly life.
					That is the eternal truth. Having faith in the eternal truth of the happiness
					and unhappiness, Sheela forgot herself in praying and worshipping God,
					she was hopeful for future happy life. While she had been passing her
					unhappy time of her life, one day at noontime someone came knocking at
					her door. She began to think, 'who would have come to my place as I am
					so poor and have nothing with me?' Still however, inspired by Aryan
					religious culture of welcoming the guests at the door, she stood up and
					opened the doors of her house.<br>
					To her wonder, she saw an old woman standing in front of her. She was a
					very old woman. Her face was dazzling with the glow of divine light. Her
					eyes were dripping with the glow of divine light. Her eyes were dripping
					the nectar of love. Her majestic face was overflowing with the compassion
					and love. Sheela experienced immense peace in her heart though she was
					not acquainted with her. She was full of delight. She welcomes her and
					gave her the only torn mat and requested her to sit with hesitation. The old
					lady said, 'Sheela! Don't you know me?'<br>
					Sheela humbly said, 'Mother, I feel delightful to see you and experience
					peace in the soul, as if I have been searching you for a long time, but it
					seems that you are not known to me!'<br>
					With a smile the old lady said, 'why! Did you forget me? Every Friday I
					used to come to the temple of Goddess Lakshmiji, when there had been
					singing praise of the Goddess. There we happened to meet each other!'
					Sheela was full of sorrow, as her husband had gone to the immoral way of
					life. She had stopped going to the temple of Goddess Lakshmiji. She felt
					ashamed to get associated with others. She tried much to recollect the
					memory of that old lady. But she was not successful.<br>
					After a while, the old lady said to Sheela, 'How sweet you had been
					singing prayer of Goddess Lakshmiji in the temple amidst the devotees!
					Now days you are not seen there. Hence I have begun to think the reason
					for it. At last I have come to see you'. Hearing the kind words of the old
					lady, Sheela's heart moved and her eyes were full of tears. She began to
					sob painfully. The old lady moved near her and began to console her
					striking lightly on her back with love. The old lady said to Sheela, 'My
					dear, happiness and sorrow are like the heat and shadow of the Sun.
					Happiness and misery come one after the other. Please have patience and
					tell me all about your sufferings. You will feel exempted from your pains,
					and will get the remedy for the same'.<br>
					Hearing the consoling words of the lady, Sheela's heart felt peace and
					comfort. She said to her, 'We were very happy in our life and enjoyed
					ourselves with the bliss in our heart. My husband was also having a good
					character. By the grace of God, we wee pleased with our financial
					position. We used to utilize our time in worshipping God. But by our ill
					luck, my husband was influenced by his bad company. At last he ruined
					the life by going on the path of immorality: drinking wine, speculation,
					gambling, race, intoxicating drugs etc. As a result we have become as
					good as beggars of the footpath'.<br>
					The old lady said, 'Dear, happiness and sorrow come one after the other.
					Moreover the end of the misdeeds is strange. Every man has to suffer the
					consequences of his good or bad deeds. Now don't get worried. You have
					already suffered all the consequences of your husband's misdeeds. Now,
					you will have happy days of your life. You are the devotee of Goddess
					Lakshmiji. Goddess Lakshmiji is the incarnation of love and compassion.
					She is very merciful to her devotees. Hence, have patience and observe
					the Vrat of the Goddess Lakshmiji and your life will be quite easy-going.'
					Having heard about the observance of the Vrat of divine Goddess
					Lakshmiji, Sheela's face glittered with light. She said to the old lady,
					'Mother! Kindly tell me how the Vrat of Lakshmiji can be observed. I will
					certainly observe it.'<br>
					The old lady said, 'The Vrat of Lakshmiji is very easy to follow. It is
					called the 'Vaibhava Lakshmi Vrat' (Vrat giving wealth) or 'Vaibhava
					Lakshmi Vrat' (Vrat giving Luxury). All the hopes of the person who
					observes the Vrat, will get fulfilled, and she or he becomes happy,
					wealthy and reputed'. Then she began to describe how to perform the
					Vrat.<br>
					'Dear, this Vrat is very simple and easy to observe. Many people observe
					this Vrat by the improper method. Hence they don't have good result.
					People believe that the Vrat can be observed only by applying yellow and
					red turmeric to golden ornaments. But it is not so. Vrat should be
					performed with proper ceremony according to the religious scriptures or
					shastras. Then only the observance of the Vrat becomes fruitful. The
					celebration of the Vrat also should be performed as prescribed by the
					shastras with proper ceremony'.<br>
					'The Vrat should be observed on Friday every week. One should put on
					clean clothes after taking bath and should utter silently 'Jai Ma Lakshmi'.
					One should not speak evil of others. Having washed hands and feet in the
					evening, one should sit on the wooden seat facing the east direction. One
					should put a big wooden seat, and then one should put a copper pot on the
					small heaps of rice arranged on the handkerchief spread on the wooden
					seat. One should keep gold or a silver ornament or a rupee coin in a small
					bowl placed on the copper pot. One should light the lamp-stand and the
					incense stick near the wooden seat." "There are many incarnations of
					Goddess Lakshmi."A person observing the Vrat of Vaibhava Lakshmi
					should devotedly see 'Shree mystical diagram' and various complexions
					or forms of goddess Lakshmiji. Then one should sing the prayer of
					Lakshmiji. Afterwards one should apply the ornament or a rupee-coin
					with the yellow and red turmeric and rice-grain. Then after adorning it
					with a red flower, one should wave lights keeping sweets or piece of
					jaggery and should utter 'Jai Ma Lakshmi'. After the rituals one should
					offer the prasad among the members of the family. That ornament or a
					rupee-coin should be put to the safe place. The water kept in the copperbowl
					should be poured into the pot of basil-plant [tulasi] and the rice grain
					should be thrown to the birds. In this way one gets his or her desires
					fulfilled by observing the Vrat according to the prescribed ceremony of
					the shastras. A Man gets wealthy by the grace of Goddess Lakshmiji. An
					unmarried girl gets married. The married woman maintains the happy
					state of wifehood and a childless woman gets a child by the influence of
					observance of the Vrat.<br>
					Sheela was pleased to know about the observance of the Vrat from that
					old lady. She said to her, 'Mother! You have shown me the ceremony of
					the Vrat. Now I will surely observe it. But please, tell me how long this
					Vrat should be done and how it should be celebrated'. The old lady said,
					'People say that this Vrat can be done in one's own way. But it is not so.
					This Vaibhava Lakshmi Vrat should be done for eleven or twenty-one
					Friday. On the last Friday, the Vrat should be celebrated offering a
					coconut and sweet dish of rice. Then on that day the sweets should be
					given to seven unmarried girls or ladies, and saying'Jai Ma Vaibhava
					Lakshmi' they should be given a book of 'Vaibhava Lakshmi Vrat'.
					Afterwards you should bow down your head to the photograph of
					Goddess Dhanlakshmi and should pray in the heart! Mother! I have
					observed the Vaibhava Lakshmi Vrat. Please fulfill all our wishes! Kindly
					give wealth to the poor and give children to the childless woman. Let the
					married woman enjoy the happy state of wifehood. Let the unmarried girl
					fulfill her desires. Please have grace on those who observe your Vrat and
					be kind to them by favoring happiness in their lives'. By praying in this
					manner, bow down your head to the Dhan Lakshmi, incarnation of the
					Goddess Lakshmiji and Keep your hand above (not to touch) the flames of
					the lamp and apply it to your eyes'. Hearing the ceremony for the
					observation of Vaibhava Lakshmi Vrat, she closed her eyes and decided in
					her mind to do the Vrat with full faith according to shastras for twentyone
					Friday and to celebrate the same with ceremony. When Sheela opened
					the eyes, she was very much surprised to know that the old lady had
					disappeared! That old lady was no one else but Lakshmiji Herself! As
					Sheela was the devoted worshipper, Goddess Lakshmiji Herself had come
					in the form of an old lady to show Sheela the path of happiness.
					On the very next day it was Friday. After taking bath Sheela began to
					utter, 'Jai Ma Lakshmi' with full faith in the Goddess Lakshmi. During
					the day she didn't defame any one. In the evening having washed her
					hands and feet, Sheela placed the wooden seat. She put her nose-ornament
					in the small bowl placed on the copper pot, which was on the heaps of rice
					arranged on the handkerchief spread on the wooden seat. Sitting in the
					east, Sheela observed the Vaibhava Lakshmi Vrat with proper ceremony
					as informed by that old lady. Then she offered some sugar to her husband.
					Immediately there was a great change in her husband's nature. As usual
					her husband did not beat her! She was very much happy to see such
					miraculous change in husband. Then after observing the Vrat with
					devotion and faith for twenty-one Friday. Sheela celebrated the last
					Friday. She gave a book of Vaibhava Lakshmi Vrat to seven ladies and
					bowing down her head to the photograph of Goddess Lakshmiji, prayed:
					'Mother! I have finished observance of the Vrat today. Kindly fulfill the
					desires of the unmarried girls and return the happiness of those who
					observe the Vrat. Be merciful to bless us with bliss of life uttering, "Give
					wealth to the poor, a child to the childless woman and preserve the
					happiness of the married woman. Kindly fulfill the desires. "Uttering these
					words, Sheela kept her hands above the flames of the lamp and applied
					her hands to her eyes and paid homage to the Goddess. In this way, Sheela
					could get the result as she had observed the Vrat according to the
					prescribed ceremony of the shastras. Her husband gave up the immoral
					way of life and began to earn with great efforts. With the pious power of
					the Goddess, her husband became wealthy. He got back the ornaments of
					Sheela mortgaged by him. Hence forward he became a noble man and
					Sheela regained the peace and happiness in her life as before.
					Having seen the pious power of the Vaibhava Lakshmi Vrat, other women
					of the street began to perform the Vrat according to ceremony described
					by the shastras. Oh! Goddess Dhan Lakshmi! Be merciful to all, as you
					had been to Sheela. Fulfill the desires of all. Bless all with peace and bliss.<br>
					Jai Ma Dhan Lakshmi! Jai Ma Vaibhava Lakshmi!!.</font><br>
