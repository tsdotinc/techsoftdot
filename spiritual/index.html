								Goddess Laxmi visited Sheela in the disguise of an old woman and explained to her the importance and procedure of the Vrat. 
								Sheela observed the Vrat methodically for 21 Fridays and Her husband eventually transformed and started working hard. 
								Sheela regained all the last wealth and in-flow of wealth increased in her house. Inspired by this, other 
								women in the neighborhood too started observing this Vrat.<br><br>

								Before beginning the Vrat a Sankalp or commitment of observing the fast for 11 or 21 days is made. 
								On the day of Vrat, a full day fast is observed by the devotee. Puja altar is decorated, a Kalash is 
								installed at puja altar and a food offering along with a silver or gold item is kept. The Vrat Katha is read, 
								Laxmi mantra is chanted, and puja is performed. On the conclusion day, a special prasad is prepared and 
								11 married women and invited and gifts, Vrat book, and prasad are offered to them.<br><br>
